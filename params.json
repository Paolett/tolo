Traditional ways of subscribing for and triggering notifications are both cumbersome and error prone with minimal compile time checking.\r\n\r\n##_Usage_\r\nTolo is intended for use as a singleton (though that is not required). The macros utilized in the examples below use the shared instance Tolo.sharedInstance. The use of these macros is optional, but it's highly recommended that you do use them.\r\n\r\n###PUBLISHING\r\nEvent publishing is straightforward using the macro PUBLISH(). This allows you to tell subscribers an action has occurred. An instance of any class may be published an event and it will only be dispatched to subscribers of that type.\r\n \r\nTo publish an event, create an instance of the event you wish to publish (for example: EventProgressUpdated) and use the macro PUBLISH() as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPUBLISH(event);\r\n``` \r\nwhere event is an instance of the event (for example: EventProgressUpdated *event = ...).\r\n\r\n###SUBSCRIBING\r\nSubscription is the complement to event publishingâ€”-it lets you receive notification that an event has occurred. To subscribe to an event, use the macro SUBSCRIBE() passing in the event type you wish to subscribe to as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSUBSCRIBE(EventProgressUpdated)\r\n{\r\n\t// use the variable event -- for example: self.progressView.progress = event.progress\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to receive events, a class instance needs to register with Tolo. To register, simply use the macro REGISTER() passing in an instance of the class:\r\n\r\n```\r\nREGISTER(self);\r\n```\r\n\r\n###PRODUCING\r\nWhen subscribing to events it is often desired to also fetch the current known value for specific events (e.g., current location, active user, etc.). To address this common paradigm, Tolo adds the concept of 'Producers' which provide an immediate callback to any subscribers upon their registration.\r\n\r\nTo create a producer, use the macro PUBLISHER():\r\n\r\n```\t\r\nPUBLISHER(EventProgressUpdated)\r\n{\r\n\treturn instance-of-EventProgressUpdated;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProducers, like subscribers, must also be registered:\r\n\r\n```\t\r\nREGISTER(self);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen registering, the producer method will be called only once for any number of subscriber previously registered for the same type. However, the producer method will also be called once for each new method that subscribes to an event of the same type.\r\n\r\nYou may only have one producer per event type registered at a time -- the last producer to subscribe is used.\r\n\r\n###THREAD ENFORCEMENT\r\nSince at times it may be ambiguous on which thread you are receiving callbacks, Tolo provides an enforcement mechanism to ensure you are always called on the main thread. By default, all interaction with an instance is confined to the main thread (this can be changes using the public property Tolo.forceMainThread -- YES by default).\r\n\r\n##_Installation_\r\nThere are two easy ways of installing Tolo:\r\n\r\n1. Drag-and-drop the files Tolo.h and Tolo.m into your project and import Tolo.h as needed, or\r\n2. Drag-and-drop the project file, Tolo.xcodeproj, into your project and add it as Target Dependencies in your project's Build Phases setting\r\n\r\nDetailed instructions will be added at a later time.\r\n\r\n####HELLOWTOLO\r\nA sample application using Tolo is can be found at HelloTolo. The application is self explanatory. You can add as many subscribers as you like on the fly interactively, while also editing the text field, which generates an event with each keystroke.\r\n\r\n####_Questions_?\r\nFeel free to contact me, Ephraim Tekle (@genzeb), if you need additional help integrating Tolo into your project.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
